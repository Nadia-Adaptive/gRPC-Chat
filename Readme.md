# Basic GRPC Chat Example

## Project Structure

**contract** - defines contract, this is where .proto file should be added
**sender** - defines a client of the chat service that subscribes to messages and sends some test messages, this is where to add your client code
**receiver** - chat chat that receives and broadcasts chat messages, this is where to add your service code

## Building

The gradle protobuf plugin is used to generate the various stubs and services. Once you have added the .proto, to generate the code execute

```shell
./gradlew generateProto
```

## Running

To run the chat, define your main class as SenderMain (or update the class name in build.gradle) in the receiver module. This starts a chat on localhost at port 8980.

To run the client, define your main class as SenderMain in the sender module (or update the class name in build.gradle). This conects to the chat on localhost:8980 and sends several chat 
messages as well as printing the responses.
